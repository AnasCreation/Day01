      <p><b>The GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB</b> is a performance-segment graphics card by NVIDIA, launched on January 12th, 2021. Built on the 8 nm process, and based on the GA106 graphics processor, in its GA106-300-A1 variant, the card supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. This ensures that all modern games will run on GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB. Additionally, the DirectX 12 Ultimate capability guarantees support for hardware-raytracing, variable-rate shading and more, in upcoming video games.</p>
      <p>The GA106 graphics processor is an average sized chip with a die area of 276 mmÂ² and 12,000 million transistors. Unlike the fully unlocked GeForce RTX 3060 3840SP, which uses the same GPU but has all 3840 shaders enabled, NVIDIA has disabled some shading units on the GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB to reach the product's target shader count. It features 3584 shading units, 112 texture mapping units, and 48 ROPs. Also included are 112 tensor cores which help improve the speed of machine learning applications. The card also has 28 raytracing acceleration cores. NVIDIA has paired 12 GB GDDR6 memory with the GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB, which are connected using a 192-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1320 MHz, which can be boosted up to 1777 MHz, memory is running at 1875 MHz (15 Gbps effective).</p>
      <p>Being a dual-slot card, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB draws power from 1x 12-pin power connector, with power draw rated at 170 W maximum. Display outputs include: 1x HDMI 2.1, 3x DisplayPort 1.4a. GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 4.0 x16 interface. The card measures 242 mm in length, 112 mm in width, and features a dual-slot cooling solution. Its price at launch was 329 US Dollars.</p>
